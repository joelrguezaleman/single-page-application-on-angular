Welcome!
===================
This project is a demo of how you can build a 100% functional website using only (and only) **Angular.js**. On this website, anything we can build with Angular, will be built with Angular. 

What is this web all about?
-------------
We're going to build a landing page for a fake startup called Angular Corporation. There will be a top menu with 4 links: Home, Team, Portfolio and Contact, and also a bottom menu with 3 links: Legal warning, Privacy policy and Licenses. 

File hierachy
-------------
There are three main folders

 - dev: this is where we will work.
 - prod: this is where we will launch our website, once it's ready for production.
 - test: this is where the unit tests will be.

Also, we will use Gulp, so we will need two files: package.json (software dependencies and general data of the project) and gulpfije.js.

License
-------------
I won't limit the use of this project at all. You're completely free to use all or some of the code that you find on this repo. I won't even ask for credit, although it would be really nice :D
