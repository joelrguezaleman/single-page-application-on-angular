Single Page Application on Angular
===================
This project is a demo of how you can build a Single Page Application using **Angular.js**.

File hierachy
-------------
There are three main folders:

 - dev: this is where we will work.
 - prod: the compiled project will be placed here, ready for production.
 - test: this is where the unit tests will be.

Also, we will use npm and Gulp, so we will need two files: package.json (software dependencies and general data of the project) and gulpfile.js.

License
-------------
You're completely free to use all or some of the code that you find on this repo. I won't even ask for credit, although it would be really nice :D
